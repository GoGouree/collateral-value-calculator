# Post Haircut Value Calculator

This project calculates the post-haircut value of securities based on the last traded price and haircut percentage. It processes all stocks with a default quantity of 1000 and allows users to specify a particular stock and quantity for a detailed notification report.

## Usage

1. **Prepare your CSV file**  
   Ensure your CSV file contains the required data format (stock names, last traded prices, haircut percentages). Save the file in the `data` folder as `sample_data.csv`.

2. **Run the application**  
   Execute the following command to run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. **Process all stocks**  
   The application will process all stocks in the file with a default quantity of 1000 and display the post-haircut values.

4. **Generate a notification for a specific stock**  
   - Select a stock name from the processed data list displayed by the application.  
   - Enter the stock name and desired quantity when prompted.  
   - The application will prepare a notification report for the selected stock.

## Module Descriptions

- **`main.py`**: Orchestrates the execution of the application.
- **`data_preparation.py`**: Reads and processes the CSV file to extract necessary data. Contains the logic to compute the post-haircut value.
- **`user_input.py`**: Handles user input for stock selection and quantity.
- **`notification.py`**: Formats the output for report/notification messages.

## Sample Data

The `data/sample_data.csv` file should contain the following columns:
- **Stock Name**
- **Last Traded Price**
- **Haircut Percentage**
